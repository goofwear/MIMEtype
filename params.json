All other\r\noffsets are handled last using a linear search.\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n\r\n- add more types (ongoing - submit an issue here if one is broken/missing)\r\n- win32 version of the magic detection (FILE* instead of fd)\r\n- config menu to enable/disable types (for servers that only want some)\r\n- cleanups\r\n    - the MAGIC tables are difficult to read and maintain\r\n    - keep the tables externally for processing\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
